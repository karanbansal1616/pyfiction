TODO - THIS EXAMPLE IS CURRENTLY OBSOLETE (breaking changes to the SSAQNAgent class were introduced)
An example agent for Saving John that uses offline learning and prioritized sampling
The samples are obtained using a random policy, meaning this method is only suitable for games where a random policy
 samples the states evenly
This agent class is universal and it should be possible to apply it to different games in the same way
